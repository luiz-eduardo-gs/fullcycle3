# Full Cycle 3
Repository destinated to save all Full Cycle 3 challenges and codes.

## Notes

* All notes will be taken using Simple Note.
* Each note will be organized as follows:
    * The note name will be the module name. Ex.: Docker -> # Docker
    * Each submodule will be a note 'h2' title. Ex.: Iniciando com Docker -> ## Iniciando com Docker
    * Each submodule will be separated from each other using '***'.
    * Each video name will be a 'h3' title. Ex.: Hello world -> ### Hello World
 
## Schedule

* The schedule will follow Anki's schedule for the 'Full Cycle 3.0' Anki's deck.
Anki ID: gs.luizeduardo00@gmail.com.
* Each Submodule will have it's flashcard. Ex.: Docker -> Iniciando com Docker.
Iniciando com Docker should be a flashcard named: Docker - Inciando com Docker.
Ex2.: DDD: Modelagem T치tica e Patterns -> Entidades. Entidades should be a flashcard named:
DDD: Modelagem T치tica e Patterns - Entidades.
Then, every time Anki show that flashcard to study, I should review the notes taken from the
submodule.
* For submodules that are practical (code and programming), I should review the concepts
of that submodule in the code. Ex.: Arquitetura Hexagonal -> Arquitetura Hexagonal na Pr치tica.
All the code here should be reviews. Ex2.: DDD: Modelagem T치tica e Patterns -> Entidades. All code
regarding entities should be reviewed.
* Exceptions may occur and should be handled as possible at that time. Ex.: Module is 80% practical and has
only one submodule (Arquitetura Hexagonal). I should whether review all the code if possible or
mark at Anki that I should review this flashcard tomorrow also, or something like this.
